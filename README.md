# Assignment 1 - Your First Application and Introduction to Git

## Author

## Description

Create a person counter. The UI should have a + button, and a - button as well as a textview to store the value of the current number.
When the app launches, the counter will be at zero. When the + button is pressed, it will increase the counter. When the - button is pressed, it will decrease the number.

If the counter goes above 20, the app will toast a message that it is over 20.

Solution Requirements:

* A plus button
* A minus button
* A textview to show the counter
* A toast message when the counter goes above 20.

The focus with this application should be getting familiar with Android Studio and Git.
